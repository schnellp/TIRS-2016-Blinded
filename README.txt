Each of the included R scripts carries out a step of the method described in the paper (beginning file 1---file 0 is a library of functions).
The script for each step begins with a configuration section that must be filled out according to each trial's requirements and previous steps.
The example folder contains the same scripts configured to reproduce the simulated case study in the paper.
